Stripe Integration
* Modify user database table to store stripe customer token (customer ID)
* Javascript should prevent pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back to customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to database.
